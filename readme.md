Play as a NATO soldier shot down over an unfriendly island. Use all means necessary to escape the island.

### Features
* Minimal weapons and ammo. You must scavenge to survive!
* Over 50 AI controlled pirate defenders
* Loot scattered across multiple hand placed, random loot-drops (Equipment boxes)
* Dozens of hand-crafted locations

### Requirements
* ACE3

_Important Notes:_
* You MUST use the Advanced ACE3 medical system to heal yourself
* Many vehicles require a tire change or similar to be drivable
* Refueling a vehicle with ACE3 is required
* Use Ace's "Free Prisoner" option to free the survivor
* Once you free the prisoner, you can ask him to come with you (do NOT use Ace's Join Group option however, as that will mean he is commanding YOU)
