##Escape from Pirate Island##

Play as a NATO soldier flying home by transport when you are shot down over an unfriendly island. Use all means necessary to escape the island.

_Features_
* Minimal weapons and ammo. You must scavenge to survive!
* Dozens and dozens of pirate enemy patrols and defenders
* Pick up loot in over a dozen hand placed loot-drop locations
* Dozens of hand crafted locations

_Important Notes_
* You MUST use the Ace medical system to heal yourself
* You can optionally fully heal yourself by sleeping for 8 hours in a sleeping bag
* Use Ace's "Free Prisoner" option to free the survivor
* Once you free the prisoner, you can ask him to come with you (do NOT use Ace's Join Group option however, as that will mean he is commanding YOU)
